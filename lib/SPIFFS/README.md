# SPIFFS library for ESP32 Arduino

# DEPRECATED:
## Due official implementation was released [here](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/SPIFFS) this unofficial will be deleted soon.

## Credits:
The example file is based and full compatible with [Official SD_MMC](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/SD_MMC) and [Official SD SPI](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/SD) libraries from Arduino ESP32.

VFS is a modified version of [ESP32 SPIFFS example of LoBo.](https://github.com/loboris/ESP32_spiffs_example)

Low level things come from [Lua-RTOS-ESP32 of Jaume Oliv√©](https://github.com/whitecatboard/Lua-RTOS-ESP32) and [SPIFFS of Peter Andersson.](https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs)
